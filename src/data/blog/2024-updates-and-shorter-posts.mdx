Woah there, it's been a while since I last wrote something here! As I was doing some housekeeping around the website,
I just randomly felt like writing an update on what I'm up to and possible future developments!

## Website updates
As I've upgraded Astro to v5 (beta), I also took the time to update the styles a bit to polish them and prepare the
changes I want to do to the website in the near future. Right now, the only significant change is regarding this very
blog! I've made the text larger, increased line spacing, tweaked titles height and decoration, hopefully improving the
overall reading experience.

I also fixed some various minor issues that have been bothering me for a while, such as the scrollbar caused a layout
shift depending on whether it is there or not. God bless our lord and savior `scrollbar-gutter`!

### Coming soon
I want to add some new sections to the site, and improve the existing ones. In no particular order:
- The list of projects is quite sad looking... They really deserve proper cards! There's also many things missing
  such as proof of concepts, contributions, etc...
- I'm considering adding a list of the things I know/use (programming languages, editors, ...) and share some of my
  dotfiles as well. I've been saying this for ~5 years, but who knows... Maybe I'll actually manage to clean them up!
- Add an "opinions" section to the website. Biggest reason for it is how fast generative AI has been growing lately,
  and I wish I had a point to reference whenever the topic is brought up. I figured it could be expanded into a more
  "generic" thing where I can just post opinionated takes on a given language, tech, or whatever.
- Attempt to make an about me that is actually descriptive. I am terrible at that but I'll try. We'll see how it goes.

Nothing's set in stone, so if you have ideas or remarks feel free to drop them on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VnxPeNHHpG),
or shoot me a DM on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:agdt777o3eknfm25dcvpueu5)!

## Personal updates
Life's been tough, I still wish my parents had used protection, but oh well. I'm in my final year of my master's
degree in software engineering, and I'm very strongly considering going for a PhD next. Not sure where that will take
me, but I might as well try and see if academia works out to be a nice place to *fuck around and find out*, or as they
say in a more professional manner, research.

I am quite interested in the formal processes of modeling and certifying software, and want to work on that. And I'm
actually at the perfect spot for it: Toulouse, the European capital of aerospace, where certification of avionic
software is quite a big deal. Given how Airbus planes don't fall from the sky, it seems like we're doing a pretty
good job here... unlike a certain american company... ðŸ˜‰

Outside of that, as of recently I've considered starting to toy with the AT Protocol and its ecosystem; the Atmosphere.
The protocol has plenty of potential, and I might try to do some things with it.

## Towards shorter posts?
I actually have a few posts that are in my drafts and need to be completed, but I never find the time and motivation
to do so (or never at the same time). I may try to post shorter things in the future, I don't know. That'd bring some
more activity to this not-very-active place but... Whether it's silly rants or whatever, I'll try to write a bit more
actively. No promises!

I may also have random snippets to share as part of the hypothetical research work I'm considering, so depending on
how that goes there'll also be that. Though, knowing myself, I'll probably have an urge to make Astro able to process
[Typst](https://typst.app/) documents if I do that... haha... ðŸ™‚

Anyway, that's pretty much it. Feel free to join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VnxPeNHHpG) for casual
discussions! I've been quite inactive there for *reasons*, but I'll try to get back at being active there...
