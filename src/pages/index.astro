			Henlo, I'm a {age} year old software engineer from Toulouse, France, who spends more time procrastinating than typing in a code
			editor. While procrastinating, some of the things I do include playing games, eating cookies, challenging
			Einstein's theory of relativity, and starting an infinite amount of side projects.
