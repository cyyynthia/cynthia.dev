			If you landed here <i>unexpectedly</i>, it probably means you've clicked on a link or button without checking...
			Thankfully, this time, it's harmless and just a silly page! üçØ

		<Section title='The risks of untrusted links'>
			<p>
				Clicking on links in emails, or online, may seem harmless especially if they look legitimate. However, you
				should <b>always</b> double check!
			</p>
			<p>
				Most software shows the real target in the <b>bottom left</b> of the window, when <b>hovering</b> the link.
				Always check, one day you might not be redirected on a harmless page like here...

					<i>I wanted to list more resources, but haven't found ones I quite liked yet...</i>

				Stay safe out there! The Internet is a scary place... üëª

		</Section>
		<Section title='Mandatory Rick-Roll'>
			<p>
				This page wouldn't be complete without a Rick-Roll! Whether it's to punish yourself, or just genuinely enjoy
				the music... Here's the link, as YouTube can't easily be embedded in a privacy-friendly manner.
